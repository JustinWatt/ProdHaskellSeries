# ProdHaskellSeries

This repository contains code related to the Production Haskell series on [Monday Morning Haskell](https://www.mmhaskell.com/). There are four articles and four branches that relate to the finished code for that article.

1. The `persistent` branch is the code after article 1, on Persistent and Postgres.
2. The `servant` branch is the code after article 2, on adding an API using Servant.
3. The `redis` branch is the code after article 3, about adding a Redis cache.
4. The `docker` branch is the code after article 4, which is all about testing our API and running it on a Docker container. (`master` will also ultimately be up to date with this branch).
